<p>Albert Whitted Airport was  established in 1929 originally as a post delivering airport stopping in cities  all around the state.  The airport was  placed on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south of the downtown area.  The airport was renovated in 2007, which  included adding a terminal building, and again in 2010.  In 2010, The Hangar Restaurant and Flight  Lounge opened on the second floor of the terminal building.  Not far from the terminal building is Albert  Whitted Park where airplane landings and takeoffs are easily seen.  &nbsp;</p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>In 1926, St. Petersburg  officials decided to construct an airport on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south  of the downtown area. On October 12, 1928, a resolution was passed by the Board  of Commissioners establishing the Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. The airport  officially opened in 1929 with a narrow shell runway. It is the first and only  municipally owned facility and the only airport to be built in the downtown  area. Within a few months of the airport’s opening, the City authorized $33,062  for the construction of a blimp hangar. The following year, the Goodyear Blimp  moved into this hangar and called it home for the next fifteen years. In  January 1931, the airport acquired Hangar No. 1.<br /></p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>In 1999, a $2.5 million renovation restored this modern example of Mediterranean Revival style building to its original grandeur – retaining the distinct historic character of its Art Deco exterior and three significant interior features -- the main entrance corridor, the main staircase with domed ceiling, and the detailed ceiling in second floor Council Chamber.<br /></p>
<p>Exterior characteristics: clay tile roof, vertical towers, with narrow windows, and wrought iron balconettes. ~ Art deco features: first floor exterior facade made of ornamental stone rustication and three large, recessed bronze windows extending from the second to third floor, surrounded by mounded, enriched tablature, finished in artificial stone with a carving of the city seal over the doorways.</p>
<p>Original interior features remaining unaltered: first floor foyer features arched ceilings lighted with suspended ornamental bronze lamps. ~ First floor hallway features elaborate domed ceilings, statuary bronze balustrade and terrazzo floors. ~ Second floor Council Chamber retains its original, unaltered ceiling -- of stained oak, cross and longitudinal beams, and hand painted details.</p>

<h3>Routes</h3>
<p>Ted Baker founded National  Airlines in October 1934 when he was awarded the 142-mile mail route between  St. Petersburg and Daytona Beach. The route included stops in Tampa, Lakeland,  and Orlando. Baker made the inaugural run on October 15 in a four passenger  Ryan monoplane from Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. He used Hangar No. 1 as a  base for the company. Over the next couple of years, routes from St. Petersburg  were extended to Jacksonville and Miami. The Miami route was so popular during  the 1936-1937 winter season that the following July the Post Office Department increased  the service from twice weekly to a daily service which made stops in Sarasota  and Ft. Myers.</p>
<p>In 1938, the company gained an additional route from  Jacksonville to New Orleans. At this time, Baker requested that the City of St.  Petersburg expand the existing facilities to include a “shop room” in order to  comply with the Department of Commerce regulations. After some negotiation, the  City agreed to construct a $6,800 lean-to at the south end of Hangar No. 1 to  encompass a dust proof repair shop, testing room, and office space.

<h3><strong>Modern Renovation</strong></h3>
<p>In October 2007 the City  completed construction of an Intermodal General Aviation Center,&nbsp;complete  with&nbsp;a 10,600sq/ft terminal building,&nbsp;a 12,200 sq/yd aircraft parking  ramp and a 64-space parking lot.&nbsp; In November 2009, the&nbsp;terminal  building&nbsp;was renamed the&nbsp;Galbraith Terminal after local philanthropists,  John and Rosemary&nbsp;Galbraith, to honor their years of support and  generosity to the local St. Petersburg community and in  particular&nbsp;the&nbsp;airport terminal project.&nbsp;The Galbraith Terminal&nbsp;houses  the airport's Fixed Base Operator (FBO), a rental car operator and other  various aviation and retail tenants.&nbsp; The Hangar Restaurant and Flight  Lounge&nbsp;opened in April 2010&nbsp;on the 2nd floor of the terminal.&nbsp;  The restaurant serves a full breakfast, lunch and dinner menu and is open to  the public.<br /></p>
