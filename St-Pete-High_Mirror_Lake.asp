<br />
<p>The St. Petersburg High School at Mirror Lake was constructed by the Pinellas County Board of Public Instruction in 1918-19 and designed by St. Louis architect William Ittner, a nationally known for his school designs. For 46 years it served as a public school (1919-1926, St. Petersburg High School; 1926-31, St. Petersburg Girl's Junior High School; 1931-64, Mirror Lake Junior High School) and from 1967-85 served as the Mirror Lake Adult Education Center. It presently houses condominiums that were built in 1991. The building holds significance in St. Petersburg as an important educational and cultural institution, serving as a high school, junior high school, vocational school and adult education center. Its Mission Revival style was a precursor of the Mediterranean Revival style of architecture which would dominate the 1920s boom era of construction in St. Petersburg. Ittner also designed the former St. Petersburg Junior High School (Tomlinson Center) and the current St. Petersburg Senior High School which opened in 1926 on 5th Avenue. </p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The St. Petersburg High  School at Mirror Lake is a four-story concrete structure that faces south  toward Mirror Lake. The building is designed in a square plan with the front  facade set back nine feet from the flat-roofed perpendicular side sections  which have simple gable-end, shaped parapets. The structure is a load bearing  building on a continuous foundation of concrete footing laid at grade. The  building's exterior walls are clad with a stucco surface imbedded with a  mixture of fine, multi-colored stones.</p>

<h3>New St. Petersburg High School History</h3>
<p>Plans for a new St.  Petersburg High School were initiated in 1916 to accommodate the rapidly  growing population of St. Petersburg, which had experienced a 46% increase in  school enrollment. A bond issue was passed in January 1917 to provide funding  for the new school to be built on the northwest side of Mirror Lake. On August  24, 1917, Ittner submitted the plans to the school board. The plans were  approved by the Pinellas County Board of Public Instruction. The site was  purchased for $25,250 and work started in June, 1918. Due to restrictions  applied to construction and materials as a result of World War I, only  government buildings were constructed during the 1917-18 period. The only other  major building constructed during this period in St. Petersburg was the U.S.  Open Air Post Office. The school was completed on November 28, 1919 and St.  Petersburg High School was officially dedicated on February 10, 1920 in a  patriotic ceremony. The school quickly became a focal point of the community  and its 1,200 person capacity auditorium was used for a variety of public  gatherings and civic meetings.</p>
