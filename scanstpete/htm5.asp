<h2>City Hall</h2>
<p>175 5th Street North, St. Petersburg Florida</p>

<div id="content">
<br />
<p>Built in 1939, St. Petersburg’s City Hall has housed the offices of city government for more than 65 years. Originally constructed as part of President Roosevelt’s “New Deal” program, St. Petersburg City Hall enjoys the distinction as one of a few buildings in this city constructed under a Public Works Administration (PWA) grant, Project No. Florida-1395-F.  According to the St. Petersburg Times on November 13, 1939, “The city’s new Municipal Building ranks with the finest in the South for architectural design and surroundings. This magnificent concrete and steel edifice was built at a cost of nearly $400,000” in federal funds.</p>
<p>This 63,000 square foot, three-story building currently houses the offices of the Mayor and City Council, City Clerk, City Administration, and departments including Budget, Citizens Police Review Committee, City Development, Community Affairs, Cultural Affairs, Intergovernmental Services, Internal Audit, Midtown Economic Development, Business Assistance Center, Neighborhood Services, Marketing and Communications, a Print Shop, www.stpete.org and WSPF-TV/STPETE TV studios. </p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>Originally, the corner site was the location of  St. Petersburg’s first school – a wooden structure constructed in 1893 at Fifth  Street and Second Avenue North.  In the  1930s, this location for a new city hall was selected to be away from the  immediate business section. The rumble of trains made it difficult to conduct  business at times since the previous City Hall, about three blocks to the  south, stood right beside the ACL Depot and railroad tracks, that extended down  First Avenue S. </p>
<p>Of the surrounding properties that were already in place during the 1930s City Hall construction, all but one remain in use today:  the Manual Training School, built by E. H. Tomlinson in 1901; the Princess Martha Hotel (built 1923); the First Baptist Church (built 1924) and St. Peter’s Episcopal Cathedral, built in 1899. </p>
<p>
The St. Petersburg  Municipal Utilities Building or City Hall is significant as being one of the  few buildings in the City constructed under a PWA (Public Works Administration)  grant. Its construction was made possible through a New Deal program of President  Franklin Delano Roosevelt's and had a great impact on the morale of the  community, struggling to free itself from the years of the Depression. The  building retains most of its architectural integrity and also retains extraordinary  interior features (the main entrance corridor, the main stairway, and the  ceiling in council chambers) which contribute to its significance. City Hall is  also the work of nationally known architect A. Lowther Forrest, prominent local  contractor R.E. Clarson, and City engineer Paul Jorgensen.<br /></p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>In 1999, a $2.5 million renovation restored this modern example of Mediterranean Revival style building to its original grandeur – retaining the distinct historic character of its Art Deco exterior and three significant interior features -- the main entrance corridor, the main staircase with domed ceiling, and the detailed ceiling in second floor Council Chamber.<br /></p>
<p>Exterior characteristics: clay tile roof, vertical towers, with narrow windows, and wrought iron balconettes. ~ Art deco features: first floor exterior facade made of ornamental stone rustication and three large, recessed bronze windows extending from the second to third floor, surrounded by mounded, enriched tablature, finished in artificial stone with a carving of the city seal over the doorways.</p>
<p>Original interior features remaining unaltered: first floor foyer features arched ceilings lighted with suspended ornamental bronze lamps. ~ First floor hallway features elaborate domed ceilings, statuary bronze balustrade and terrazzo floors. ~ Second floor Council Chamber retains its original, unaltered ceiling -- of stained oak, cross and longitudinal beams, and hand painted details.</p>
</div>

<h3>Ceilings</h3>
<p>Inside the main entrance  there is a transverse hall, divided by arch treatment into three sections. The  center section has an ornamental groined and ribbed arch ceiling. In addition,  there are a total of eight ornamental bronze hanging lamps in the front  entryway. Over the main staircase leading to the second floor is an elaborate  domed ceiling, richly decorated and finished in old ivory. Walls on each side  are finished in select Alabama marble.<br /></p>
</div>


<hr/>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Stairway</h3>
<p>On the stair landing  remains a 7 ft. by 10 ft. mural one of two painted by the artist George Snow  Hill. They were commissioned by Mayor Walfred Lindstrom and City Council in  1940 under a federal art project of the Works Progress Administration, but  World War II terminated the project. Hill continued to work on the murals at  his own expense and donated them to the city when he was finished.<br /></p>
        </div>


<hr/>
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Council Chamber</h3>
<p>Opening from the second  floor hall directly at the head of the main stairway is the council chamber.  The interior of council chambers has been altered over the years, but the  ceiling which is in stained oak, with cross and longitudinal beams that have  been beautifully hand-painted, remains unaltered and is a significant feature  of the building.</p>
