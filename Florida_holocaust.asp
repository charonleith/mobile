<h2><strong>Florida Holocaust Museum</strong></h2>
<p>55 Fifth Street South, St. Petersburg Florida</p>

<br />
<p>The  Florida Holocaust Museum honors the memory of millions of innocent men, women,  and children who suffered or died in the Holocaust. The museum is dedicated to  teaching members of all races and cultures to recognize the inherent worth and  dignity of human life in order to prevent future genocides.</p>
<p>One of the largest  Holocaust museums in the country, the Florida Holocaust Museum is the result of  Saint Petersburg businessman and philanthropist, Walter P. Loebenberg’s  remarkable journey and vision. Loebenberg escaped Nazi Germany in 1939 and served  in the United States Army during World War II. Together with a group of local  businessmen and community leaders, the concept of a living memorial to those  who suffered and perished was conceived. Among the participating individuals  were Survivors of the Holocaust and individuals who lost relatives, as well as  those who had no personal investment, other than wanting to ensure that such  atrocities could never again happen to any group of people.</p>

<h3>History</h3>
<p>In the 1930s, Tampa  already had a strong orchestra scene with a WPA orchestra, and by the mid  1940s, the Tampa Symphony Orchestra was born, although it would be renamed the  Tampa Philharmonic in 1959. Similarly, across the bay in St. Petersburg,  community and city orchestras had already formed by the mid-to-late 1940s, and  in 1950, members of the Carreno Music Club formed the St. Petersburg Symphony.  Talks of the two orchestras merging began to surface  in 1964. </p>
<p>An official intent of the  merger was made on November 23, 1966, and on that day, representatives from  both the Tampa Philharmonic and the St. Petersburg Symphony traveled by boat to  the center of Tampa Bay, where they married the two institutions in a symbolic  union and became the Florida Gulf Coast Symphony. The merger became official  two years later, and the Florida Gulf Coast Symphony opened its first season on  November 14, 1968. The orchestra continued to perform as the Florida Gulf Coast  Symphony until its name was changed to The Florida Orchestra in 1984. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>In 1926, St. Petersburg  officials decided to construct an airport on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south  of the downtown area. On October 12, 1928, a resolution was passed by the Board  of Commissioners establishing the Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. The airport  officially opened in 1929 with a narrow shell runway. It is the first and only  municipally owned facility and the only airport to be built in the downtown  area. Within a few months of the airport’s opening, the City authorized $33,062  for the construction of a blimp hangar. The following year, the Goodyear Blimp  moved into this hangar and called it home for the next fifteen years. In  January 1931, the airport acquired Hangar No. 1.<br /></p>
