<h2><strong>Florida Craftsmen, Inc.</strong></h2>
<p>501 Central Avenue, St. Petersburg Florida</p>

<br />
<p>The Florida Craftsmen,  Inc. was originally organized by Louis and Elsa Freund, professors at Stetson  University in Deland, FL in 1951. Elsa was a jeweler and the couple felt that  an organization dedicated to fine craft would elevate the art form to the  status it so rightly deserved. Exhibitions were organized and held annually at  galleries, art centers and colleges throughout the state of Florida beginning  with an exhibition at Florida State University in 1951. The organization was incorporated in 1977 but had no  official headquarters. Instead, it continued the tradition of an annual  exhibition and conference with workshops featuring local and national  craftsmen. </p>
<p>Florida Craftsmen settled  into its first physical home when Florida Progress offered space in their  building in downtown St. Petersburg in 1986. Several years later, Florida  Progress needed the space and Florida Craftsmen moved to the McNulty building  in 1992. Neither site was conducive to walk-by traffic or had the look of a  true gallery. It was not until 1995, when George Rahdert offered a reasonable  rental agreement for the old Rutland Department store that Florida Craftsmen  had a true space which looked and felt like a gallery.</p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>In 1926, St. Petersburg  officials decided to construct an airport on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south  of the downtown area. On October 12, 1928, a resolution was passed by the Board  of Commissioners establishing the Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. The airport  officially opened in 1929 with a narrow shell runway. It is the first and only  municipally owned facility and the only airport to be built in the downtown  area. Within a few months of the airportâ€™s opening, the City authorized $33,062  for the construction of a blimp hangar. The following year, the Goodyear Blimp  moved into this hangar and called it home for the next fifteen years. In  January 1931, the airport acquired Hangar No. 1.<br /></p>
