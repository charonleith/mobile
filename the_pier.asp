<h2><strong>The Pier</strong></h2>
<p>800 2nd Avenue Northeast, St. Petersburg Florida</p>

<div id="content">
<br />
<p>From its humble beginning  as a railroad trestle devoted to the delivery of goods into the city from Tampa  Bay, the city of St. Petersburg has always had a pier. The city's first pier  dates back to 1889, when the Orange Belt Railway constructed the &quot;Railroad  Pier&quot; as a railway-accessible sightseeing and recreational resort for  locals and tourists.</p>
<p>Several piers followed,  and the most significant was the &quot;Million Dollar&quot; pier with  construction completed in 1926. Its Mediterranean revival architecture was a  major feature and the Million Dollar pier became a popular community gathering  space until it was demolished in 1967 to make room for the new Inverted Pyramid  building.</p>
<p>  In 1973 the Inverted Pyramid structure was  completed and opened to the public. It continued the tradition of an over-water  public gathering place and tourist attraction in downtown St. Petersburg. The  Pier again will be demolished in order to construct a new pier. A committee is  developing a new design to replace the current building. </p>

<h3>Construction</h3><br />
<p>There are components of  the Pier approach and head that date back to its original 1926 construction.  Today, the Pier suffers from concrete and structural deterioration due to  corrosion of the reinforcing steel causing concrete spalls, cracks and  de-laminations. Despite repairs, super-structure elements continue to  deteriorate due to the elements and age. Continued general re-pairs do not  increase the load carrying capacity of the structure, and are not seen as a  viable long-term solution.</p>
<p>The Inverted Pyramid  building does not rely on the 1926 original Pier Head for support; rather it is  supported by an independent foundation which consists of four - 20' x 20'  square concrete caissons, which may be incorporated into possible future  designs. The Pier Approach and Head surrounding the Inverted Pyramid building  require replacement. The Pier Head superstructure will also need to be  replaced, which will require the removal of the existing retail space on the  ground level of the Pier Building.</p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>In 1926, St. Petersburg  officials decided to construct an airport on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south  of the downtown area. On October 12, 1928, a resolution was passed by the Board  of Commissioners establishing the Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. The airport  officially opened in 1929 with a narrow shell runway. It is the first and only  municipally owned facility and the only airport to be built in the downtown  area. Within a few months of the airport’s opening, the City authorized $33,062  for the construction of a blimp hangar. The following year, the Goodyear Blimp  moved into this hangar and called it home for the next fifteen years. In  January 1931, the airport acquired Hangar No. 1.<br /></p>
