<p>The original Florida  Suncoast Dome was opened to the public on March 3, 1990, at a cost of $138  million. It became the Thunder Dome in 1993 with the arrival of the area's  National Hockey League expansion franchise, the Tampa Bay Lightning. It was  renamed Tropicana Field on Oct. 4, 1996, in accordance with a naming rights  agreement between the Rays and Tropicana Dole Beverages North America, located  in Bradenton. Though originally built for baseball, there have been 16  other sports and competitions presented in the facility. These include hockey,  basketball, football, sprint car racing, gymnastics, soccer, tennis,  weightlifting, ping-pong, karate, motorcycle racing, equestrian events, track  and figure skating. </p>

<h3>Renovations</h3><br />
<p>Tropicana Field closed its  doors in 1996 for a 17-month, $85 million facelift that transformed the  facility from functional to innovative, incorporating baseball traditions  throughout the dining, shopping and entertainment complex while adding 319,000  square feet of space. In 2006, the Rays spent more than $10 million on  improvements to Tropicana Field. The renovations included major overhauls of  the bathrooms, new lighting, new fixtures, new wall treatments, a new premium  seating club, changes to the press box, and much more. In addition, interactive  baseball-themed areas were added throughout the ballpark for families to enjoy  a new kind of fan experience.   </p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>In 1926, St. Petersburg  officials decided to construct an airport on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south  of the downtown area. On October 12, 1928, a resolution was passed by the Board  of Commissioners establishing the Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. The airport  officially opened in 1929 with a narrow shell runway. It is the first and only  municipally owned facility and the only airport to be built in the downtown  area. Within a few months of the airport’s opening, the City authorized $33,062  for the construction of a blimp hangar. The following year, the Goodyear Blimp  moved into this hangar and called it home for the next fifteen years. In  January 1931, the airport acquired Hangar No. 1.<br /></p>
