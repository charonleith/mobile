<h2><strong>Sunken Gardens</strong></h2>
<p>1825 4th Street North, St. Petersburg Florida</p>
<img src="images/sunken_gardens.jpg" alt="Location Photo">
<div id="content">
<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1903 a plumber by the name of George Turner, Sr.  purchased the six acres  that would become a world famous botanical attraction. Using an elaborate maze  of clay tiles, he drained an ancient lake on the property, leaving a rich muck  soil that was ideal for his favorite hobby – gardening. Neighbors so enjoyed  strolling through Mr. Turner's garden, that by the early 1920's, he was  charging a nickel for tours. Three generations of the Turner family continued  the vision that created this unique tropical garden, with its flowing ponds. The City of St. Petersburg purchased Sunken Gardens  in 1999  with funds from a voter approved tax. Preserving the garden was a community  effort. With Mr. Turner Sr.'s original vision in mind, the city's goal is to  preserve this historic botanical garden and provide cultural and educational  opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>The main building on Fourth Street was built in 1926 </strong>and became the Coca Cola Bottling Company in the 1940s. The Turner family purchased the building in 1967 to create the World's Largest Gift Shop and the King of Kings Wax Museum. They closed the building in 1995. The city has restored it to its original Mediterranean Revival style and it is the new home for Great Explorations, a children's science museum.</p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>In 1926, St. Petersburg  officials decided to construct an airport on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south  of the downtown area. On October 12, 1928, a resolution was passed by the Board  of Commissioners establishing the Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. The airport  officially opened in 1929 with a narrow shell runway. It is the first and only  municipally owned facility and the only airport to be built in the downtown  area. Within a few months of the airport’s opening, the City authorized $33,062  for the construction of a blimp hangar. The following year, the Goodyear Blimp  moved into this hangar and called it home for the next fifteen years. In  January 1931, the airport acquired Hangar No. 1.<br /></p>
