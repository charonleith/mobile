<p>The Vinoy Park Hotel was built in 1925 signifies the changing character and scale of hotels in St. Petersburg.  Henry L. Taylor from New York designed the hotel and was used by the US Army during World War II, after which was closed in 1975.  After a $93 million renovation took place in the early 1990s, the run down hotel soon became one of the most elegant Mediterranean Revival style hotels in the south.</p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>The Vinoy Park Hotel, built  in 1925, is one of the largest of St. Petersburg’s &quot;Boom Era&quot; hotels.  The owner and promoter of the Vinoy was Aymer Vinoy Laughner, a millionaire who  moved to St. Petersburg in 1920. The Vinoy was designed by Henry L. Taylor of  New York, who designed several other prominent St. Petersburg buildings such as  the Florida Theater, which was the first air-conditioned theater in St.  Petersburg. During World War II, the Vinoy was used by the US Army for  training. In 1975, the Vinoy closed and became a popular spot for homeless  people to reside. Eventually in the early 1990s, the hotel was bought by a  partnership of Renaissance Hotels and Resorts and the Vinoy Development  Corporation. They conducted a $93 million renovation and two years later it  reopened. </p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The Vinoy’s  Mediterranean Revival style of architecture featured a central block of seven  stories with four canted wings. On the northeast, southwest, and northwest were  five story wings containing bed/sitting rooms. The two story southeast wing  houses the dining area. The main entrance was through an arcade in the south  facade of the central block. At the west end of the central block was an  observation tower, a typical feature of Mediterranean style architecture,  rising several stories above the roof parapet. This tower, the main entrance  and the major windows of the dining room have elaborate detailing in stucco.  Around the windows of the top story and on the ballroom façade are scraffito  murals. Visible roof surfacing was clay tile. Expense was not spared on the  interior spaces of the Vinoy either. The entrance arcade stretching the length  of the central block was floored in quarry tile. Parallel but interior to the  loggia is a vaulted two-story lobby with balconied mezzanine and exposed pecky  cypress timbers.</p>
