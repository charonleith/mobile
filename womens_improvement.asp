<h2><strong>Women’s Town Improvement Association</strong></h2>
<p>336 1st Avenue North, St. Petersburg Florida</p>
<!-- <img src="images/pier.jpg" alt="Location Photo"> -->
<div id="content">
<br />
<p>The  “W.T.I.A.” building was built by the Women's Town Improvement Association, who  was responsible for numerous town beautification projects and other social and  cultural advancements. Many of the City's most influential women were members  of the W.T.I.A., which served St. Petersburg for more than four decades.  There have been numerous renovations over the  years.</p>
<p><br />
  
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The Neoclassical style  building is two-stories in height with the main facade looking onto Williams  Park. The imposing brick facade stretched east-west from property line to  property line but was set back from the sidewalk approximately nine feet to  accommodate a large wooden porch and second story veranda. The north facade was  two stories in height, capped by a decorative wooden cornice hood with a  decorative raised parapet wall. A wooden porch and second story veranda ran the  entire length of the main facade. This porch connected the building to the  sidewalk. It featured paired Ionic columns supporting the second floor veranda,  spindle railings and classically inspired trim details all of which define the  Neoclassical design style. The wooden porch was supported by a rusticated block  foundation.</p>
</div>

<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>First Renovation</h3>
<p>Three major building projects and numerous minor renovations have significantly altered the appearance of the building and its interior layout. During World War I, a large red cross was placed on the second floor veranda to signify the building was the St. Petersburg chapter of the American Red Cross. The original alteration removed the Ionic columns and replaced them with square brick pilasters. The wooden porch deck and railings were also removed and a concrete floor system was added. The original wooden veranda floor deck and porch ceiling remained.</p>
</div>
  
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Second Renovation</h3>
<p>The second major renovation took place in 1931 when the YWCA owned the building. They operated a cafeteria on the first floor and occupied the second floor with offices and meeting facilities. The change to retail space required the demolition of the remaining portions of the original porch and veranda, and the removal of all alterations made to the front of the building since construction in 1913. A cast stone facade in the Art Deco style was installed. The addition raised one story and reintroduced the veranda with a solid railing on the second floor.</p>
</div>
  
<div data-role="collapsible">
<h3>Continued Renovations</h3>
<p>In June 1950, the YWCA sold the building to the Dennis Hotel. Architect E. B. Hadley of St. Petersburg prepared plans to convert the second floor into ten hotel rooms each containing a bathroom, and the construction of one apartment. A second-story bridge was built to connect the Dennis Hotel to the W.T.I.A. building. Building records indicate the store front was altered again in 1968. Renovations were confined to the first floor only and did not alter the appearance of the second floor. Renovations included the installation of a product identified as "Glassweld facing," a mineral fiber material which is painted in gloss finish. This material covered the entire cast stone store front and removed the transom area of the store fronts.</p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>In 1926, St. Petersburg  officials decided to construct an airport on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south  of the downtown area. On October 12, 1928, a resolution was passed by the Board  of Commissioners establishing the Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. The airport  officially opened in 1929 with a narrow shell runway. It is the first and only  municipally owned facility and the only airport to be built in the downtown  area. Within a few months of the airport’s opening, the City authorized $33,062  for the construction of a blimp hangar. The following year, the Goodyear Blimp  moved into this hangar and called it home for the next fifteen years. In  January 1931, the airport acquired Hangar No. 1.<br /></p>
