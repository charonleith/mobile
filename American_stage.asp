<br />
<p>American Stage was founded as The Palisades  Theatre Company, which had a temporary residence at Florida Presbyterian  College (now Eckerd College) from 1977 to 1979. Initial programming consisted  of a touring educational production, which later grew into the School Tour. The Junior League of St. Petersburg provided funds to convert an old  cinema house in downtown St. Petersburg into a 179-seat performance space. With  a non-union acting company in residence, the theatre originated its Main stage  subscription series, a five-play series now in its twenty-seventh season. In  1996, renovation on the facility was completed, including the redesigned  148-seat space, a new sound system, a new lighting board and dimmers, and  remodeling of the costume shop and rehearsal space.</p>

<h3>American Stage in the Park</h3><br />
<p>In 1986, American Stage Shakespeare in the Park  was launched with a free outdoor production of Shakespeare's <em>The Taming of the  Shrew</em>. Ten performances for 8,000 patrons began a community  tradition now eagerly anticipated every spring by the entire Tampa Bay region.  Following the success of the 1985-86 season, the company was able to reinstate  the educational touring program for children with Shakespeare's <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>.<br /></p>

<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>In 1926, St. Petersburg  officials decided to construct an airport on a landfill by Bayboro Harbor, south  of the downtown area. On October 12, 1928, a resolution was passed by the Board  of Commissioners establishing the Albert Whitted Municipal Airport. The airport  officially opened in 1929 with a narrow shell runway. It is the first and only  municipally owned facility and the only airport to be built in the downtown  area. Within a few months of the airportâ€™s opening, the City authorized $33,062  for the construction of a blimp hangar. The following year, the Goodyear Blimp  moved into this hangar and called it home for the next fifteen years. In  January 1931, the airport acquired Hangar No. 1.<br /></p>
