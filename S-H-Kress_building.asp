<h3>History</h3><br />
<p>Built in 1927, the Kress  Building is a classically styled commercial building most influenced by the  Beaux-Arts style. It was continuously used as a five-and-dime store until  closed by S. H. Kress &amp; Company around 1981. The Kress Building was built by  Samuel H. Kress, founder of the S.H. Kress chain of five and dime stores. Mr.  Kress retained an architectural staff to design many of his buildings, although  the architect of St. Petersburg's Kress Building is unknown. Today  uses in the building are a mixture of offices and services. </p>

<h3>Architecture</h3>
<p>The Beaux-Arts style is a  highly ornamental style of architecture that originated from the Ecole des  beaux-arts. Although the Kress Building is not an elaborately decorative  building, it does feature the figure sculpture (urns, brackets) along the  parapet that is so common with the Beaux-Arts style, in addition to be clad with  glazed terra cotta tile. The building is less ornamental and shows some influence  from Commercial style buildings. The Kress Building is a four-story (plus  basement and mezzanine) masonry building with a spread footing foundation. The  ground floor facade of the building is extra long, accounting for the mezzanine  level within the building. It features a largely glass expanse on both the  southern (front) and western exposures. The front entrance consists of two  plain commercial glass doors topped by a multi- light transom window and  flanked by two concrete block piers. The upper three levels of the south  elevation are clearly more classical in design than the ground/mezzanine level.  Separating the ground floor and mezzanine from the upper portion of the  building is a classical decorative string course featuring an acanthus leaf  pattern. The cornice is topped by a classically detailed parapet featuring a  central raised portion containing the name &quot;Kress&quot; flanked by two  urns and two decorative brackets. The western facade of the Kress Building is  similar in detail to the south (front) facade, excluding the main entrance. The  upper three floors are divided into eight bays with identical ornamentation as  that on the front; the parapet level also features the central raised portion  with the &quot;Kress&quot; name.</p>
